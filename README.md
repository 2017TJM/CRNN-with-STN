# CRNN-with-STN
implement CRNN in Keras with Spatial Transformer  Network

DIDN'T FINISH YET.

BUT you can run CRNN individually by just deleting STN components. The CRNN can reach 90% of recognition accuracy.

train on Synthetic Word Dataset realsed by M. Jaderberg et al. You can download the dataset [HERE](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/text/#sec-synth)
