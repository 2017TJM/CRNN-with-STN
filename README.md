# CRNN-with-STN
implement CRNN in Keras with Spatial Transformer  Network

Trainable but performance of recognition is not improved, meanwhile the loss raises up.

You can run CRNN individually by just deleting STN components as well. The CRNN can reach 90% of recognition accuracy.

train on Synthetic Word Dataset realsed by M. Jaderberg et al. You can download the dataset [HERE](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/text/#sec-synth)
